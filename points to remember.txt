
How to create Robust system in .net core
1)Design the application using modular component
2)leverage .net core built in DI container to manage component dependencies
3)optimizer i/o operation
4)implement caching for frequently used data
5)implement authentication and authorization for security
6)implement logging framework for debugging and performance monitoring
7)implement a combination of unit tests and integration test to validate code functionality

How to Preventing System crashes
1)Global Exception handling using custom middleware
2)Proper disposal of unmanaged resources
3)Implement Retry and Timeout policies to prevent indefinite waiting
4)Implement Async programming to prevent blocking operation
5)Implement loggin and monitoring for debugging and analysis
6)Regular updates and Patching of existing packages



how to culture fit with Client
1)Be clear and concise-Use simple, direct language and speak at a steady pace.
2)Use visuals: Supplement verbal communication with diagrams, charts, and 
other visuals to explain complex ideas more effectively.
3)Research about client's culture
4)Promote open communication: feel safe to ask clarifying questions and raise concerns without fear of judgment.
5)Maintain transparency and regular contact
6)Focus on client solutions



client requrements process:
1)Define project goals

2)Identify stakeholders

3)Prepare for meeting

4)Focus on understanding the client's needs by listening carefully to their verbal and non-verbal cues.

5)Don't make assumptions. If something is unclear, 
ask questions to confirm your understanding and 
verify your interpretation of their business processes.

6)Document everything: Record all requirements, assumptions, 
and decisions made during the meeting in a clear, transparent, and organized manner.

7)Review and confirm:Share the documented requirements with the client to ensure everyone has a shared and 
accurate understanding. Ask for confirmation on any ambiguities.

8)Internal review:Discuss the gathered requirements with your project team to ensure a 
common understanding before proceeding.

9)Finalize and approve:finalize the requirements document, and obtain formal approval from the client.



Pipeline issue

1)Syntax erros:missing semicolons, incorrect variable names

2)Unit or integration tests failing due to broken code, 
incorrect configurations, or dependency mismatches

3)Pipeline lacking necessary permissions to access resources 

4)Incorrect or missing dependencies

5)Environment Differences

6)Jobs or tasks exceeding their configured timeout limits
